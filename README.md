# Jumpstart-Webpage-Replica
These are two static webpages created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
The first file to run is "homepage.html" which is a static webpage of the website Jumpstart created using HTML5 and CSS3. 
The page has some hover effects which are given by CSS. 
The page is redirected to "loginpage.html" using JavaScript by clicking on the "LogIn" button to open a login page, which is also static and has some hover and focus effects using CSS.
These pages are just a static replica of the Jumpstart website.
